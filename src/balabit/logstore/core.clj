;; ## Developer documentation
;; - - - - - - - - - - - - -
;;
;; This documentation is geared towards people who wish to dive into
;; the depths of the `balabit.logstore` library. It contains the full
;; documentation and full source (minus the test suite) of the
;; library, not only the API meant for end-users.
;;
;; It's considerably longer and more in-depth than the public API
;; docs, and the choices and solutions made and chosen during
;; development are better explained herein.
;;
;; Nevertheless, as every documentation, this is also probably far
;; from being complete, yet, I hope it will sched some light on the
;; inner workings of the library.
